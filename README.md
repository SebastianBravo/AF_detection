# AF_detection

## Description:

* Preprocessing of ECG signals (Filtering, normalization, downsampling).
* Feature extraction from ECG signals (RR intervals, P wave, QRS complex, T wave).
* Training of a deep neural network (DNN) for classifying ECG recordings as Atrial Fibrillation or Normal Control patients.

## QRS detection:
